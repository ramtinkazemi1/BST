# Binary Search Tree (BST)

The Binary Search Tree (BST) project is an implementation of a data structure that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data elements. It provides functionalities for ordering and filtering data based on specific criteria.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement a Binary Search Tree and utilize it for ordering and filtering data from a text file. The BST allows fast insertion, deletion, and search operations, making it suitable for managing large datasets.

### Input

The project takes input in the form of a text file containing file system information. Each line in the file represents a file and includes the following details:

- File name: The name of the file.
- Directory: The directory where the file is stored.
- Last modified date: The date when the file was last modified.

### Output

The project provides several functionalities to process and manipulate the input data:

- Ordering by name: The BST orders the files alphabetically by name.
- Filtering by date: The BST filters files based on a specific date or date range.
- Outputting file information: The project generates lists of files, including their names and associated details, in the desired order.

## Implementation

The BST is implemented using the Java programming language. It provides the following functionalities:

- Insertion: Files are added to the BST, maintaining the proper ordering based on file names.
- Deletion: Files can be removed from the BST, adjusting the structure accordingly.
- Searching: The BST allows efficient searching for specific files based on their names or other criteria.
- Ordering: The BST orders files alphabetically by name, enabling easy retrieval and sorting.
- Filtering: The BST supports filtering files based on specific dates or date ranges, facilitating data selection.

The project leverages the principles of binary search trees, such as maintaining the correct order of elements and optimizing search and retrieval operations. It follows established algorithms and data structures to ensure efficient performance.

## How to Use

To use the project:

1. Prepare a text file containing the file system information.
2. Ensure that the file follows the specified format: each line represents a file with its name, directory, and last modified date.
3. Execute the project code, providing the input file as an argument.
4. The project will process the input file, build the BST, and provide various functionalities for ordering and filtering the file data.
5. Explore the project's functionalities to order, filter, and retrieve file information as required.

Please refer to the project documentation or comments within the code for detailed usage instructions and additional information.
